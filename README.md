live_show_web project helps people to make simple websites and view them lively just below the editor and make changes to website using the editor provided by the team.


Install and run project:

use npx create-react-app app_name

Next to it run
npm i codemirror react-codemirror2

This is for the editor we use in the website. It provides control over the editor.

We require some icons in the website. So we use fontawesome icons. We need to run the following command

npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core

Next and the most important step:

Replace the public, scr folder and package.json file  with the folders and files given in repository(For simplicity purpose the project is uploaded without node modules. This is the reason why you have to use the command npx create-react-app app_name and create a new app)

After making all these changes we are good to go
